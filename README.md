AI-Powered Pneumonia Detection System
This project is a full-stack web application that uses a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It features a PyTorch backend for model training and inference, and a sleek, futuristic front-end for user interaction.

Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet18 model for high accuracy through transfer learning.

Class Imbalance Handling: Implements a weighted loss function during training to counteract the imbalanced dataset.

Full-Stack Application: A complete end-to-end system with a Python/Flask backend and an HTML/Tailwind CSS/JavaScript front-end.

Interactive & Responsive UI: A modern, futuristic user interface that allows for easy image upload and clear visualization of results.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, PyTorch, Flask, Safetensors

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

Core Libraries: torchvision, Pillow, flask-cors

Directory Structure
To run this project, your folder must be organized as follows. The chest_xray dataset folder should be placed in the root of the project directory.

Setup & Installation
1. Prerequisites:

Python 3.8 or higher

pip for package management

2. Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Pneumonia-Detection-System

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision flask flask-cors safetensors pillow

5. Download the Dataset:

Download the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from this Kaggle page.

Unzip the file and ensure the chest_xray folder is in the root of your project directory as shown in the structure above.

How to Run the Application
Step 1: Train the Model

Run the training script from your terminal. This will train the ResNet18 model and save the pneumonia_model_resnet.safetensors file.

python pneumonia_trainer_improved.py

(Note: This may take some time depending on your hardware. If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, it will be significantly faster.)

Step 2: Start the Backend Server

Once the model is saved, run the Flask backend server.

python backend.py

You should see messages indicating that the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Step 3: Use the Web Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

You can now upload a chest X-ray image and get a prediction from your model!

File Descriptions
pneumonia_trainer_improved.py: The script used to train the deep learning model. It handles data loading, augmentation, training, validation, and saves the final model.

backend.py: The Flask server that loads the trained model and provides a /predict API endpoint for the front-end to call.

index.html: The complete front-end user interface. It contains the HTML structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling image uploads and displaying results.

pneumonia_model_resnet.safetensors: The saved weights of your trained model (generated by the training script).
